# Remita Interbank Transfer Service (RITs) PHP SDK
This is the PHP SDK for the Remita Interbank Transfer Service.

# Prerequisites
The workflow to getting started on RITs is as follows:
Register a profile on Remita: You can visit Remita to sign-up if you are not already registered as a merchant/biller on the platform.
Receive the Remita credentials that certify you as a Biller: SystemSpecs will send you your merchant ID and an API Key necessary to secure your handshake to the Remita platform.

## Requirements
SDK works with PHP 5.7 or above.

# Basic Usage
## Configuration
All merchant credentials needed to use RITs are being setup by instantiating the Credential Class and set the properties in this class accordingly. Properties such as MerchantId, ApiKey, ApiToken, Key, Iv and the Environment needs to be set.

Note: Environment can either be $demoUrl or $liveUrl, each of this environment has it respective Credential. Ensure you set the right credentials. By default Environment is $demoUrl.
 ```php
    $merchantId = "KUDI1234";
    $apiKey = "S1VESTEyMzR8S1VESQ==";
    $key = "cymsrniuxqtgfzva";
    $iv = "czidrfwqugpaxvkj";
    $apiToken = "dWFBTVVGTGZRUEZaemRvVC8wYVNuRkVTc2REVi9GWGdCMHRvWHNXTnovaz0=";
    
    // INIT CREDENTIALS
    $credentials = new Credentials();
    $credentials->url = ApplicationUrl::$demoUrl;
    $credentials->key = $key;
    $credentials->iv = $iv;
    $credentials->apiToken = $apiToken;
    $credentials->apiKey = $apiKey;
    $credentials->merchantId = $merchantId;
    
    RITsGatewayService::init($credentials);
 ```
 
## CREDENTIALS
Before calling the RITs methods, the SDK needs to be initialized with the Credentials object, see below:
### Credentials attributes
|Field  | Type    | Required   | Description   |   
| ---   | ------  | -----------| -------- |   
| $merchantId| String | Yes| SystemSpecs will send you your merchant ID necessary to secure your handshake to the Remita platform.
| $apiKey | String | Yes| SystemSpecs will send you your an API Key necessary to secure your handshake to the Remita platform.
| url | String | Yes| ApplicationUrl::$demoUrl for Demo server. While ApplicationUrl::$liveUrl for Production server.
| $iv | String | Yes| SystemSpecs will provide an iv required to encrypt your request data with AES to secure your handshake to the Remita platform.
| $key | String | Yes| SystemSpecs will provide a key required to encrypt your request data with AES to secure your handshake to the Remita platform.
| $apiToken | String | Yes| SystemSpecs will send you your an API Token necessary to secure your handshake to the Remita platform.

# METHODS
## Adding Account(s)
Adding an account to your merchant profile on the RITs is a dual process.
The first step is to AddAccount, Fields required to add account includes the following;
accountNo: This is the number of the bank account being linked to merchant profile
bankCode: This is the CBN code of the bank in which the account is domiciled
transRef: This uniquely identifies the transaction
requestId: This uniquely identifies the request
```php
$addAccountRequest = new AddAccountRequest();
$addAccountRequest->accountNo = "044332222";
$addAccountRequest->bankCode = "044";
$response = RITsGatewayService::addAccount($addAccountRequest);
 ```
### $response attributes
| Name  | Type    | 
| ---   | ------  | 
| $status | String |
| $data | Data |  

### $data attributes
| Name  | Type    |
| ---   | ------  | 
| $remitaTransRef | String |
| $authParams | array(AuthParms) |  
| $responseId | String |
| $responseCode | String |
| $responseDescription | String |
| $mandateNumber | array(Objects) |
 
### $authParams attributes
| Name  | Type    |
| ---   | ------  | 
| $description1 | String |
| $description2 | String |  
| $label1 | String |
| $label2 | String |
| $param1 | String |
| $param2 | String |
Note: See 'TestRITSServices.php' in SDK on how to reference response data/attributes.

## Validate Accounts
The second step validates the account holder via bank authentication on the account details. You will be required by your bank to validate the account details the AddAccount request is being issued for, required fields(Payloads) are as follow;
card: This is the one of the authentication detail required by the bank from the account owner to validate AddAccount request
otp: This is the another authentication detail required by the bank from the account owner to validate AddAccount request
remitaTransref: This uniquely identifies the specific add account request the validation is being called for
requestId: This uniquely identifies the request

``` php
        $otp = "1234";
        $card = "0441234567890";
        $remitaTransRef = "MTUxNjYwOTcxNzM3MQ==";
        $key = utf8_encode(RITsGatewayService::$credentials->key);
        $iv = utf8_encode(RITsGatewayService::$credentials->iv);
         
        // ENCRYPTING DATA
        $otp_encrypted = AES128CBC::encrypt($otp, $iv, $key);
        $card_encrypted = AES128CBC::encrypt($card, $iv, $key);
        $remitaTransRef_encrypted = AES128CBC::encrypt($remitaTransRef, $iv, $key);

        $validateAccountOTPRequest = new ValidateAccountOTPRequest();
        $validateAccountOTPRequest->remitaTransRef = $remitaTransRef_encrypted;

        $authParams = new AuthParams();
        $authParams->param1 = "OTP";
        $authParams->value = $otp_encrypted;

        $authParams2 = new AuthParams();
        $authParams2->param2 = "CARD";
        $authParams2->value = $card_encrypted;

        $validateAccountOTPRequest->setAuthParams(array(
            $authParams,
            $authParams2
        ));
       $response = RITsGatewayService::validateAccountOTP($validateAccountOTPRequest);
```
### $response attributes
| Name  | Type    | 
| ---   | ------  | 
| $status | String |
| $data | Data |  

### $data attributes
| Name  | Type    |
| ---   | ------  | 
| $remitaTransRef | String |
| $accountToken | array(undefined) |  
| $responseId | String |
| $responseCode | String |
| $responseDescription | String |
Note: See 'TestRITSServices.php' in SDK on how to reference response data/attributes.

## Payments
Payments on the RITs platform can only be made from Remita-identifiable accounts. This means that before an account can be debited on the RITs, it must be linked to a profile. Merchants may process payments via the following SDK methods on the platform:

##Single Payment Request: 
This charges/debits a merchantâ€™s account with a specified amount to credit a designated beneficiary account. Fields(payload) to set include:
fromBank: This is the CBN code of the funding bank
debitAccount: This is the funding account number
toBank: The CBN code of destination bank where account number to be credited is domiciled. (You can use the Banks Enquiry method to get the list of all supported Banksâ€™ code).
creditAccount: This is the account number to be credited in destination bank.
narration: The narration of the payment. This will typically be visible both in the debit and credit account statement. Max length 30 characters
amount: The amount to be debited from the debitAccountToken and credited to creditAccount in bank toBank. Format - ##.##
beneficiaryEmail: Email of the beneficiary (email of creditAccount holder)
transRef: A unique reference that identifies a payment request. This reference can be used sub- sequently to retrieve the details/status of the payment request
requestId: This uniquely identifies the request

```php
        $paymentSingleRequest = new PaymentSingleRequest();
        $paymentSingleRequest->fromBank = "044";
        $paymentSingleRequest->debitAccount = "1234565678";
        $paymentSingleRequest->toBank = "058";
        $paymentSingleRequest->creditAccount = "0582915208017";
        $paymentSingleRequest->narration = "Regular Payment";
        $paymentSingleRequest->amount = "5000";
        $paymentSingleRequest->beneficiaryEmail = "qa@test.com";
       $response = RITsGatewayService::singlePayment($paymentSingleRequest);
```
